# Freaksins e-commerce websiteðŸ‘½

## What is thisðŸ“•
This is an e-commerce website for a brand. I built this website as a way for the brand owner to simplifly transactions and reach a wider audience. Though not used in the final production, I am still proud of the project as it provided me a lot of knowledge especially about hosting and caching

## Tech stack usedðŸ˜¤:
- PHP for backend
- MYSQL for database
- Basic html, css and Javascript
- SemanticUI for easier styling
